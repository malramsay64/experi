Examples
--------

This is a collection of examples files demonstrating how to use the
experiment.yml file. The examples should be run and experimented with.


The `simple.yml` file is a very simple example which will `echo` the variables
in combinations to the screen. The intention is that you play with this to
understand how the combinations of the variables works.


The `demo.yml` file is the file that we end up with at the end of the [input
file tutorial][experiment docs]. It used some of the more complicated logic
that is available.

The `pbs.yml` file demonstrates setting up a file for submission to a batch
scheduler. As long as there is no batch scheduler the submission files are
generated so this can be tested on a regular machine before trying it out on
a cluster.

The `crystal_liquid_interface.yml` file is a file that I am using in my
research demonstrating man of the capabilities of the specification. It
demonstrates the complexity of the file specification that is available.
